# Contributing

All contributions are welcome.  A suggested order of operations is given:

_**Do not forget that documentation is a valid (and coveted) contribution!**_

* [Open up an issue](https://github.com/jrop/perplex/issues/new) - This is a great opportunity to gather feedback on what you may need.  While contributions are welcome, it is possible that your vision and my vision for the project may not align.  Opening an issue is a great way to start a discussion instead of me receiving a pull-request out-of-the blue.
* Once the above has been completed, fork this repo, and make your changes
* Submit a pull-request with passing tests
